From site:
"This project employs the use of a MPU6050 to detect and transmit motion information to a HC05 master bluetooth module. 
After calibration, the HC05 interprets the raw data and sends the corresponding movement instruction (i.e. forward, back, left, right)
to the HC06 slave  bluetooth module. At this end, the received motion data is sent to an L293D driver to provide power to the car
